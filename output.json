Markets were shocked last week when September core inflation rose to 6.6% year over year, above expectations and months after the Federal Reserve has been jacking up interest rates to cool down prices.\nA promising sign is that the five-year expected annual inflation sitting around 2.4%, implying a steep decline from the current 8% run rate.\nAnother factor to fuel a bull run is a decline in real rates.\"TIPS and Fed Funds Futures prices do currently support the idea that in six months inflation will be dropping and Fed policy will be moving into neutral,\" Colas said.\nThe Fed looks set to raise interest rates for the fifth time this year in November.

The Tesla CEO seems 'excited' to be the new Twitter CEO, despite his belief that he spends too much time on the social media platform.\nElon Musk expressed excitement on Wednesday about his pending acquisition of Twitter Inc, although he and other investors were overpaying for the social media company.\nMusk was responding to a question during a conference call following the company's quarterly report. The world's wealthiest person is pursuing the Twitter acquisition after attempting to back out of the $44 billion deal.\nTwitter, according to Musk, had 'languished' for a long time. \"Myself and the other investors are clearly overpaying for Twitter at the moment. Twitter's long-term potential, in my opinion, is orders of magnitude greater than its current value,\" he said.\nMusk also expressed optimism about Tesla during the same conference call. Tesla, which has a market cap of less than $700 billion, could be worth more than Apple Inc's $2.3 trillion and Saudi Aramco's $2.1 trillion, he claims.\nMusk has been trying to raise funds to fund the Twitter acquisition, and some experts believe he may need to sell about $3 billion more in stock after Tesla's quarterly report to do so.\nA Delaware judge halted Twitter Inc's lawsuit against Elon Musk, giving the billionaire until Oct. 28 to complete the transaction.\nTesla investors were concerned that the billionaire would sell more Tesla stock to finance the deal, spreading himself too thin and causing shares to fall.\nMusk, CEO of SpaceX, Neuralink, and Boring Company, stated on Wednesday that he does not currently have plans to merge his companies with Twitter.\nAlso Read:",

        "body": ". Margins also came in lighter than anticipated as CFO Zachary Kirkhorn cited raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange as the biggest headwinds hitting the automaker in Q3.\nShares of the worlds most valuable automaker slid over\n6%\nin early trading on Thursday, trending toward a 52-week low marked on Friday, October 14.\nStill, CEO Elon Musk remained characteristically exuberant on the long-term trajectory of the company. Lamenting his belief that market themes revolve around the short term, he voiced his confidence in the companys ability to continue to deliver value for shareholders. Pointing to past performance as an indicator, Musk said he sees a path for the auto manufacturer to become the most valuable company in the world.\nIm of the opinion that we can far exceed Apples current market cap, Musk told analysts. In fact, I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined.\nThat growth would imply an over $4T market cap for Tesla (\nTSLA\n). While he added that the path to this valuation will be very difficult, he doubled down and indicated that he believes his company could be worth roughly twice the value of Saudi Aramco. Musk said during Wednesdays earnings call that this is the first time he has foreseen this potential.\nWhile the call was met with understandable skepticism on Wednesday, Musk has previously made good on bullish promises. For example, he proclaimed in 2015 that the automaker would exceed a $700B valuation. At the time, the company was worth only about $25B.\nIn terms of promises Elon Musk has yet to make good on, the Tesla semi, full-self driving, and Cybertruck have long been glaring examples. The semi truck was first unveiled in November 2017 with production slated for 2019. Meanwhile, the Cybertruck made its on-stage debut in late 2019 with a promise to be available for sale by 2021. Finally, a long history of fully autonomous promises from Musk was perhaps best exemplified by the April 2019 declaration that 1M robotaxis would be on the road by the end of 2020.\nHowever, the Tesla (\nTSLA\n) frontman offered yet more commentary on the subjects on Wednesday, remaining optimistic on many of these fronts.\nWere in the final lap for Cybertruck, Musk said. Were building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.\nEarly production of the Cybertruck was slated for mid-2023. Meanwhile, Musk reiterated that Tesla Semis are set for delivery to Pepsi on December 1. For autonomous driving, Musk was extremely confident in the safety of the FSD Beta rollout.\nThe safety that were seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety were seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta, he told analysts on Wednesday.\nThe automaker has been selling a full-self driving add-on since 2016, charging customers up to $10K at the time for the stated capability.\nIn ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land & not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY, Elon Musk tweeted in January 2016.\nThe price tag for the Full Self-Driving (",

        "body": "Tesla vehicles comes with a standard Autopilot feature\nSpecial investigations into Tesla crashes have been opened\nMusk hopes to show regulators that FSD is safer than an average human\nTesla's advanced driver assistant software won't gain regulatory approval in 2022, CEO Elon Musk said in remarks which indicate the company is not yet able to satisfy authorities that its cars can be driven without someone behind the wheel.\nThe Silicon Valley automaker sells a $15,000 (roughly Rs.12,45,000) software add-on called \"Full Self-Driving\" (FSD) which enables its vehicles to change lanes and park autonomously. That complements its standard \"Autopilot\" feature which enables cars to steer, accelerate and brake within their lanes without driver intervention.\nHowever, the cars still need to be driven with human oversight. A completely autonomous vehicle would require regulatory approval.\nMusk\ntold a post-earnings call on Wednesday that all FSD users in North America will get an upgraded version at the end of the year, adding that while its cars are not ready to have no one behind the wheel, drivers would rarely have to touch the controls.\n\"The car will be able to take you from your home to your work, your friend's house, the grocery store without you touching the wheel,\" he said.\n\"It's a separate matter as to will it have regulatory approval. It won't have regulatory approval at that time,\" he added.\nEU Car Makers May Soon Get a Level Playing Field With US EV Manufacturers\nMusk also said Tesla hopes to provide an update to FSD in 2023 to show regulators that the car is much safer than the average human.\n\"Musk is opening the possibility Tesla will have a more difficult path to approval for FSD given heightened NHTSA and other scrutiny,\" said Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth Capital.\nTechnology Questions\nAuto safety regulators have long been at loggerheads with Tesla over its partially automated driving systems. Since 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened 38 special investigations into crashes involving Tesla vehicles that have resulted in 19 deaths, looking at whether the software was a factor.\n\"Translation: Tensions between NHTSA and Tesla will ramp at the end of the year and Tesla will move forward,\" said Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, which owns Tesla shares.\nTesla's naming of its software has also caused consternation, with the automaker accused by a California state transportation regulator of false advertising since the features do not provide full autonomous vehicle control.\nTesla's website says both technologies \"require active driver supervision,\" with a \"fully attentive\" driver whose hands are on the wheel, \"and do not make the vehicle autonomous\".\nSome analysts say, however, that Tesla's primary problem is not regulators but the software itself, given the complexity of autonomous driving.\n\"The impediment is the technology. It is not about approval of that technology,\" said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina.\nTesla has repeatedly missed self-imposed targets for its vehicles to achieve full self-driving capability - a function that Musk has said will eventually would become \"the most important source of profitability for Tesla.\"\n Thomson Reuters 2022\nIs the Redmi Pad the best budget tablet you can purchase under Rs. 20,000?

Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said that while President Joe Biden has drained the strategic oil reserve to its lowest level in nearly 40 years, China is accumulating more oil. \nRodgers said, Its just outrageous what President Biden is doing right now with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is now at the lowest level since 1984. And meanwhile, China is hoarding more oil. They now have the largest oil reserve. It does not mean anything. And we are anxious for election day. We very much want the Republicans to get a majority in the House so that we can unleash American energy, so that we can send a strong signal that we want more oil and natural gas production in the United States of America . We want to build more refineries. We want to export LNG to our allies around the world. But we also want to send a strong signal to the investment community that they need to fund, they need to invest in US oil and natural gas. It is so essential for our national security, for our economy. The foundation of our economy is energy. And I cant overstate how important it is for us to unleash American energy, to invest in energy infrastructure, more pipelines, hydro, nuclear, clean coal. We have abundant energy resources in the United States. Its fundamental to our way of life, our leadership, and Republicans are ready to move this agenda forward.\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter\nKevin Durant said he wanted to beat the snot of the New Orleans Pelicans in the season opener.\nIt was the Pelicans who beat and the Nets who left boogers all over their house.\nThe Nets walked out of Barclays Center beaten, bruised and with their tails between their legs after taking a knock on opening night. They never led, only kept up the momentum once  when they cut the deficit going into half-time  and trailed to 26 in their 130-108 loss against the Pelicans on Wednesday.\nThey beat us in every category tonight, head coach Steve Nash said after the game. Its really about the level of competition and how elevated it is now that the season is here, and it was a great kind of wake-up call of what the norm is.\nTheres a lot to take away from a game in which the Nets (0-1) lost, as Nash said, in every category. For starters, they dont have the size to really compete with bigger teams, as evidenced by the Pelicans 22-board advantage in rebounding margin and huge 36-4 disparity in second-chance points. .\nNets general manager Sean Marks opted out of tackling a heavyweight big man this past offseason to give the Nets the size they lost when Andre Drummond signed with the Chicago Bulls. While the Knicks had signed seven-footer Isaiah Hartenstein  who filled his first game well against Grizzlies bruiser Steven Adams while Mitchell Robinson was in trouble  the Nets started Nic Claxton and brought out the big man sophomore DayRon Sharpe off the bench.\nIt did not work.\nJonas Valanciunas is one of the strongest centers in all of basketball, and Williamsons size and strength precede his name. The Pelicans eventually outscored the Nets, 61-39, a margin equivalent to the 22-point deficit in the final score.\n[Weve got to] box, put a body on people, dont let them get into our paint on defense, Durant explained after the game. You let a team into your paint, you let your guys on the perimeter, now theyre crashing for the glass so we have to keep the ball out of the paint. [If] theyre shooting at us, so their team has no choice but to come back in defense instead of crashing, so we just have to keep the teams out of the paint.\nThe Nets dont seem to have a satisfying answer to what they can do differently in future matchups against other big teams, because boxing doesnt always work when the opponent is downright stronger. These bad matchups are going to happen often given the Eastern Conference landscape: The Bucks, Celtics, 76ers and Cavaliers are each bigger than the Nets, and each of those teams plans to stand between their championship hopefuls.\nAside from the rebounding disparity, theres been a distinct drop in effort  like in the Pelicans, the Nets worked hard all night. It was more or less the same as last season and the season before, where the Nets wouldnt bring the fight until an opponent punched them in the mouth.\nThe Pelicans, more specifically, headbutt the Nets square in the nose. Their efforts were reflected in all categories: more assists, fewer turnovers; better offensive flow, more defensive intensity.\nIts a grown mens league and the most physical team wins, and New Orleans came with the intention of showing us why theyre going to be chasing championships in the next few years, said Kyrie Irving after the game. They have a good base with Brandon Ingram and Zion [Williamson] then add a defensive-minded player like Herbert [Jones] and [then] CJ McCollum and they all clicked tonight. You only see the dashboard breakdown. They did everything.\nWhich brings us to the worst moment of the night: unfortunately, it was Ben Simmons.\nSimmons fouled out after just 23 minutes and had just four points, five rebounds and five assists. He didnt look like the player the Nets envisioned as a powerhouse on both offense and defense. Instead, that motor sputtered and the nets failed.\nSimmons, of course, was playing his first official regular season game in over a year after sitting out the entire 2021-22 NBA season due to mental health issues and a necessitating lower back injury. off-season surgery. He, his teammates and the organization are optimistic about a season where, like fine wine, he will gradually improve as the season progresses.\nIt takes time. Having had back surgery and being out of the game for a year, there are little things your mind might tell you to go do something, but your body doesnt want to go do that , he said after the game But its the habits, its something I just have to keep focusing on and being aggressive regardless of the result.\nFrom now on, time is on the Nets side. It was just Game 1 of 82, and the Nets missed two key players  sharpshooters Joe Harris (foot pain) and Seth Curry (ankle surgery rehabilitation)  as well as a wild card. in the rehabilitation of striker TJ Warren (foot injury rehabilitation).\nThe loss  the lopsided nature of their defeat, that is  serves as a reminder that this season will not be a walk in the park. The Nets have all the talent on paper, but it will take a year of games to build the chemistry and cohesion needed to beat the leagues elite.\nIts possible, as long as they dont fracture from the inside during the hard times.\n()\nRajesh Khanna\nAs for any fear that The daily show could miss a step in Noahs absence, Wood Jr. made sure to crush those concerns.\nThe daily show is an institution, he said. A friend of mine said to me a long time ago, We dont own these jobs, we rent them out. So everything is temporary. Whether its Kilborn or Jon or Trevor, whatever the next iteration of T",

        "body": "ACC reports surprise quarterly loss as expenses surge\nNEW DELHI: Tesla Inc said on Wednesday it expected to miss its vehicle delivery target this year, but downplayed concerns about softening demand after its revenue missed Wall Street estimates.\nChief executive Elon Musk told analysts on a conference call there was excellent demand in the fourth quarter, addressing investors' concerns that buyers could be discouraged by the weak global economy and high prices for Tesla vehicles.\nBut Tesla said some logistics challenges would persist, with fourth-quarter deliveries growing by less than 50% while production rose 50%.\n\"I wouldn't say we're recession proof, but it's certainly recession resilient,\" Musk said.\nPreviously, Tesla had repeatedly said it was aiming for 50% growth this year from the 936,172 cars it delivered in 2021.\nIts shares fell 4.3% in after-market trading.\nTesla is expanding fast despite global economic jitters, and investors are closely watching for signs that consumer demand is cooling as inflation surges and interest rates climb. The company's third-quarter automotive gross margin was 27.9%, missing analysts' estimates and down from 30.5% a year earlier.\nRevenue for the third quarter was $21.45 billion, a record but short of analysts' estimates of $21.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\nThe company said it had a negative foreign exchange impact of $250 million on its earnings as the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies.\n\"Raw material cost inflation impacted our profitability along with ramp inefficiencies\" from its new factories in Berlin and Texas, and the production of its new 4680 batteries, according to Tesla's statement. Musk added that production of the 4680 battery was gaining rapid traction, although executive Andrew Baglino said, \"There are challenges still ahead that we have not yet surpassed. No doubt.\"\nMusk added that Tesla's Semi trucks, which would start to be delivered to customers beginning this December, will not use the 4680 battery cells. Musk also said the company has the ability to do a stock buyback in the range of $5 billion to $10 billion, pending board review and approval.\nEarly this month, Tesla said it delivered 35% more vehicles in the July-September period than in the previous quarter, thanks in part to a rebound in China output after lengthy Covid-19 disruptions, but the record number was shy of vehicle production and analysts' estimates.\nThe electric vehicle pioneer has seen its shares tumble about 50% from record highs last November as investors were spooked by fears of a global economic slowdown and Musk's bid to buy social media company Twitter.\nMusk told the conference call he saw a path for Tesla to be worth more than two mammoth companies, Apple Inc and Saudi Aramco, combined. Tesla's market cap is now under $700 billion, while Apple is worth $2.3 trillion and oil producer Saudi Aramco is worth $2.1 trillion.\nAnalysts had expected Musk to voice optimism about Tesla in the conference call. Musk has been trying to raise cash to fund his $44 billion deal to take Twitter Inc private. Some experts say Musk may need to sell about $3 billion more in stock after the earnings announcement to help fund the deal.\nMusk on Wednesday said he was excited about his pending acquisition of Twitter Inc, though he said he and other investors were overpaying for the social media company.\nMusk also said Tesla's Cybertruck pick-up truck was on track to enter production in the middle of next year and its heavy duty semi truck could see 50,000 units in North America in 2024.\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nFacebook",
